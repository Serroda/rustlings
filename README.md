Solutions for V5.6.1

## Getting Started

_Note: If you're on MacOS, make sure you've installed Xcode and its developer tools by typing `xcode-select --install`._
_Note: If you're on Linux, make sure you've installed gcc. Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`. Yum: `sudo yum -y install gcc`._

You will need to have Rust installed. You can get it by visiting <https://rustup.rs>. This'll also install Cargo, Rust's package/project manager.

Basically: Clone the repository at the latest tag, run `cargo install --path .`.

```bash
# find out the latest version at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/releases/latest (on edit 5.6.1)
git clone https://github.com/Serroda/rustlings.git
cd rustlings
cargo install --force --path .
```

If there are installation errors, ensure that your toolchain is up to date. For the latest, run:

```bash
rustup update
```

Then, same as above, run `rustlings` to get started.

## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `rustlings/exercises/<topic>`. For every topic there is an additional README file with some resources to get you started on the topic. We really recommend that you have a look at them before you start.

The task is simple. Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and it's up to you to fix it! Some exercises are also run as tests, but rustlings handles them all the same. To run the exercises in the recommended order, execute:

```bash
rustlings watch
```

This will try to verify the completion of every exercise in a predetermined order (what we think is best for newcomers). It will also rerun automatically every time you change a file in the `exercises/` directory. If you want to only run it once, you can use:

```bash
rustlings verify
```

This will do the same as watch, but it'll quit after running.

In case you want to go by your own order, or want to only verify a single exercise, you can run:

```bash
rustlings run myExercise1
```

Or simply use the following command to run the next unsolved exercise in the course:

```bash
rustlings run next
```

In case you get stuck, you can run the following command to get a hint for your
exercise:

```bash
rustlings hint myExercise1
```

You can also get the hint for the next unsolved exercise with the following command:

```bash
rustlings hint next
```

To check your progress, you can run the following command:

```bash
rustlings list
```
